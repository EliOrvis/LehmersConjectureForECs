This repository contains the following:

Data > raw datafiles organized by conductor
     > pickled pandas datasets containing only curves where a point has been found, and with the constant in Lehmers conjecture added as an additional column
Programs > a Magma program file used to compute the raw data, and a Sage program file that reads the raw data into a Pandas dataset for investigations
